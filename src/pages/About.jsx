            <p>
              Our founder faced a real-life challenge while running Tyler Petroleum, a $60+ million annual revenue business. He relied on multiple platforms like Bill.com, Deluxe Checks, and Mint.com for payments, banking, and tracking, leading to inefficiency and frustration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by his experience managing thousands of vendors, serving as a Local ATM Processor, and operating retail and Western Union locations, he envisioned an all-in-one solution. This led to the creation of ZilRemit powered by Zil Moneyâ€”a unified platform simplifying payments and banking for businesses everywhere.
