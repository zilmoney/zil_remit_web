If ZilRemit successfully stops the payment, you will receive a return of the funds to the original Funding Source. In the event that ZilRemit cannot effectuate the stop payment, you must request a return of the funds directly from the Payee or other recipient.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Informal Negotiations</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms (each “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Binding Arbitration</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Dallas, Texas. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Dallas, Texas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Restrictions</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Exceptions to Arbitration</p>
<br>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. Any party – be it a white-label customer, an embedded customer, or any specific type of customer – that introduces their own clientele to this platform under a previously agreed arrangement, such as a flat fee or revenue share, assumes responsibility for all financial losses associated with their customer(s). This includes, but is not limited to, any losses arising from ACH dispute reversals or other productivity-related issues pertaining to their customer(s) or the utilization of their white-label platform.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">ZilRemit is a fintech, not a bank. FDIC coverage is provided through our partner banks Texas National Bank and Lincoln Savings Bank., with insurance applying only to eligible deposits. “Zero transaction fees,” cash-back rewards, “instant,” “same-day,” and “in few minutes” payments apply only to qualifying transactions as defined in the ZilRemit Terms & Conditions and may depend on cut-off times, corridor availability, network conditions, and compliance reviews. “Up to 90% cost savings” is based on internal comparisons with traditional wire fees in Ripple-supported corridors and may not represent actual results. International and wire transfer times vary by country, receiving banks, and regulatory requirements. Digital checks are provided by ZilRemit, not by partner banks; timing depends on recipient banks and postal delivery where applicable. Metrics such as transaction volume, business counts, and bank integrations reflect cumulative totals to date and are not independently audited. Features like bulk payments, reconciliation, integrations, and reporting may vary depending on third-party providers and user setup. ZilRemit uses SOC 2 standards, encryption, and multi-factor authentication to protect transactions. Customer testimonials reflect individual experiences; results will vary.
