However, please note that ZilRemit will not be liable if such stop payment request is not successful.  ZilRemit will collaborate with you to stop a Business Payment, but you acknowledge that ZilRemit may not always have the capacity to stop such a payment. If ZilRemit successfully stops the payment, you will receive a return of the funds to the original Funding Source. In the event that ZilRemit cannot effectuate the stop payment, you must request a return of the funds directly from the Payee or other recipient.</p>
