<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">When businesses send money abroad, there is often one phrase that causes hesitation: <strong>pre-funding foreign accounts</strong>. On the surface, it sounds like a normal part of global payments. But in reality, it is one of the main reasons many businesses face frozen cash flow and unexpected risk.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Let's break it down. Pre-funding means you deposit your own money into an account before sending it to your overseas partner or vendor. In other words, your funds sit idle, sometimes for days, while banks or middlemen process the transfer. That is your working capital, locked away, not earning, not helping your business grow.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">Now imagine a better way: no pre-funding required. That is exactly what <strong>ZilRemit.com</strong> offers.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zil-blue mb-6">What Does "No Pre-Funding" Really Mean?</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Traditionally, businesses that send international payments must deposit funds into a foreign account before making a transaction. This is called "pre-funding." It is meant to ensure liquidity on the other end, but it ties up your money, sometimes for days, before it even reaches your supplier or partner.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">With Zil Remit's no pre-funding model, you only pay when you actually make the transfer. There is no need to park funds in a separate account overseas. That means your money keeps working for you until the very moment it is needed.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zil-blue mb-6">Real-World Impact: How Businesses Gain from "No Pre-Funding"</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">Let's take an example.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">A U.S. based supplier sends regular payments to partners in Germany and the Philippines. Under a pre-funding model, they must hold €10,000 and ₱500,000 in separate accounts to maintain payout readiness.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-3">
        <li>That same business keeps all funds in its main account until payments are due.</li>
        <li>Exchange rates are calculated at the time of sending, ensuring real time accuracy.</li>
        <li>Payments reach recipients within minutes, not days.</li>
    </ul>
