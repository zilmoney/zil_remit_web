                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zil-blue mb-8">Why Ireland Matters for Your Business</h2>

                    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Ireland has firmly established itself as a global hub for technology, pharmaceuticals, and finance. As a member of the European Union, it offers a strategic gateway to the continent's 450 million consumers. Its highly skilled, English-speaking workforce and business-friendly environment have attracted multinational corporations and startups alike, creating a dynamic ecosystem for trade and innovation.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                        Whether you are sourcing cutting-edge software from a Dublin-based tech firm, collaborating with a research team in Cork, or hiring talented freelancers from across the country, seamless payment processing is essential. Slow, expensive, and opaque transactions are no longer an option for businesses that want to stay competitive.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zil-blue mb-8">Seamless Payments to a Dynamic Economy</h2>
