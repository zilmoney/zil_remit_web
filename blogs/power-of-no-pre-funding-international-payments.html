<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">In international trade, working capital is essential for growth, yet traditional international payments often come with a significant drawback: pre-funding. To ensure timely payments to global vendors, businesses were forced to lock up capital in float accounts or foreign currency reserves for days or even weeks. This not only tied up resources but also introduced float risk, limiting cash flow and restricting operational flexibility.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">With No Pre-Funding, that outdated model is a thing of the past. Now, businesses can make international payments instantly, without needing to tie up capital in separate accounts. This breakthrough approach is revolutionizing global B2B payments, freeing up cash for inventory, expansion, or marketing while boosting liquidity and enhancing operational efficiency.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zil-blue mb-6">The Problem with Pre-Funding and Float Risk</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">In the typical scenario, to pay a vendor in Europe or Asia, a business must:</p>

<div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-xl p-8 mb-8">
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed"><strong>Fund a separate holding account:</strong> This immediately ties up capital that sits idle before the payment is even initiated.</p>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed"><strong>Endure the delay:</strong> Once the transfer is sent, your funds are held up for 2–5 business days as they pass through multiple intermediary banks. This delay is the definition of float risk—the time your money is out of your control, exposed to exchange rate volatility, and unavailable for other urgent needs.</p>
    
    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed"><strong>Absorb Hidden Costs:</strong> At each step, a new intermediary bank can levy a fee, or apply a non-transparent exchange rate markup, quietly draining your budget.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-zil-blue mb-6">The ZilRemit.com Advantage: On-Demand Liquidity and Zero Float Risk</h2>
