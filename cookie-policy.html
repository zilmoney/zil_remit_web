<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Websites may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as Local Shared Objects or “LSOs”) to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to “information” on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Do you serve targeted advertising?</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">ZilRemit is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services are provided by FDIC-member partner banks, with insurance applying only to eligible deposits. “Zero transaction fees,” cash-back rewards, “instant,” “same-day,” and “in few minutes” payments apply only to qualifying transactions as defined in the ZilRemit Terms & Conditions and may depend on cut-off times, corridor availability, network conditions, and compliance reviews. “Up to 90% cost savings” is based on internal comparisons with traditional wire fees in Ripple-supported corridors and may not represent actual results. International and wire transfer times vary by country, receiving banks, and regulatory requirements. Digital checks are provided by ZilRemit, not by partner banks; timing depends on recipient banks and postal delivery where applicable. Metrics such as transaction volume, business counts, and bank integrations reflect cumulative totals to date and are not independently audited. Features like bulk payments, reconciliation, integrations, and reporting may vary depending on third-party providers and user setup. ZilRemit uses SOC 2 standards, encryption, and multi-factor authentication to protect transactions. Customer testimonials reflect individual experiences; results will vary. All services are subject to applicable laws, regulations, and the full ZilRemit Terms & Conditions on our legal page.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">ZilRemit is a financial technology company, not a bank. ZilRemit offers banking services through partnership with FDIC member banks Texas National Bank. Customers are not directly insured by the FDIC – but through the pass-through coverage of our partner banks and is conditional on proper titling, record-keeping, and custodial arrangements.</p>            </div>
