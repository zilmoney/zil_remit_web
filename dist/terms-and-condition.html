<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The funds transfer services underlying Business Payments are provided by our third-party financial institution service providers (“Payment Provider”). We reserve the right to change Payment Providers without prior notice to you. At no time does Zil receive, hold, or control any funds in connection with Business Payments. You agree that any future changes to the applicable Payment Provider terms and conditions will apply to your use of the Business Payments Service regardless of whether or not Zil or the Payment Provider notifies you of those changes, including in the event that Zil changes the Payment Provider to a new financial institution service provider.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">(ii) Funding Sources.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Business Payments may be made using certain payment methods, including ACH or wire transfers from your bank account, cards, credit cards, and ACH transfers from your Deposit Account (each, a “Funding Source”). You agree and represent that any Funding Source you use for Business Payments is connected to an account that you own and that you are fully entitled to use such Funding Source for Business Payments. In order to use the Business Payments Service, you must provide all information required by Zil or the Payment Provider for each Funding Source. You agree to provide complete and accurate information for each Funding Source and to promptly notify us of any changes to Funding Source information you have previously provided. All information you provide relating to Funding Sources shall constitute Company Information for purposes of this Agreement and the Zil Privacy Policy. Neither Zil nor the Payment Provider will have any liability for relying on the Funding Source information provided by you in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">(iii) Payment Instructions and Authorization.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">You can initiate a Business Payment through your Zil Account or by other means that Zil may make available to you. Company hereby authorizes Zil and the Payment Provider, upon receipt of payment instructions from you, to facilitate payments from the applicable Funding Source to your designated Payee or transfers of funds from the applicable Funding Source to your bank account, your Deposit Account, or a third-party’s Deposit Account in accordance with the payment instructions. You may be required to provide additional written authorizations in connection with a particular Funding Source such as ACH Authorization Forms as well as the authorization forms of our parnters.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Zil and the Payment Provider each has the right in its sole discretion, for any or no reason, to reject any payment instructions or to cancel a Business Payment.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Company shall promptly notify Zil upon learning of or suspecting any errors or inaccuracies in any payment instructions and cooperate with Zil and the Payment Provider to correct any Business Payments that are misdirected, unauthorized, erroneous, or duplicative. Company acknowledges and agrees that Zil does not guarantee or have control over or liability for: (a) any inaccurate or incomplete payment instructions received from Company; (b) any payment received within or outside a timeframe agreed to between Company and a Payee; (c) insufficient funds in or the closure of any Funding Source indicated in any payment instruction; or (d) any return of or refusal to accept any Business Payment by a Payee or the financial institution holding the Payee’s account.</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">You may request a stop payment of any Business Payment by contacting us at support@onlinecheckwriter.com or support@zilmoney.com.  If you submit a timely stop payment request  before funds are transferred to the Payee or any other recipient through a check, wire transfer, or ACH or prior to the use of a virtual card issued to a Payee, Zil will make reasonable efforts to act on the request. However, please note that Zil will not be liable if such stop payment request is not successful.  Zil will collaborate with you to stop a Business Payment, but you acknowledge that Zil may not always have the capacity to stop such a payment. If Zil successfully stops the payment, you will receive a return of the funds to the original Funding Source. In the event that Zil cannot effectuate the stop payment, you must request a return of the funds directly from the Payee or other recipient.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">(vi) Fees are determined by payment plan that you are in. These plans can be found at https://onlinecheckwriter.com/pricing/ or https://zilremit.com/pricing/</p>

<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Informal Negotiations</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms (each “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Binding Arbitration</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Dallas, Texas. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Dallas, Texas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Restrictions</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">Exceptions to Arbitration</p>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court. Any party – be it a white-label customer, an embedded customer, or any specific type of customer – that introduces their own clientele to this platform under a previously agreed arrangement, such as a flat fee or revenue share, assumes responsibility for all financial losses associated with their customer(s). This includes, but is not limited to, any losses arising from ACH dispute reversals or other productivity-related issues pertaining to their customer(s) or the utilization of their white-label platform.</p>
